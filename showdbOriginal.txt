These opening sets are sometimes referred to as "Jazz Odyssey," as the lone known taper labeled his master tapes as such.  The antelope is hilarious, trey told the story of what happened to Fishman and explained that Fish, who had been at the top of a mountain and, therefore late for the gig, had to "Run like an Antelope, out of control." Check out this tape and listen to trey chide Fishman for his tardiness. The narration in Harpua was straight forward with no teases.  Anarchy included teases of Whipping Post.  Many tapes mislabeled this venue as Fly Me to the Moon Saloon."	"Phish"	"13135"

Show time was approximately Noon to 2:00 p.m. Attendance was approximately 400-450. *Trey was getting strange feedback and crackling noises; he said that they would play the song again at the end of the set. **Before "Back on the Train," the technical problem was fixed by "Bill Brown," as annouced by Trey. +Messed up first time around; then quickly re-started. ***After "Piper," fans were yelling many requests for such songs as "Mound" and "Esther" (possibly "Destiny"). Trey responded by saying that people always call for such songs, and "it's not that we don't want to play it, but we just forgot how...we want to as much as you." He also said that they came to see Bela Fleck for Austin City Limits in 1993 and pointed out where they sat. Trey went on to say that they don't usually play with a pre-written setlist, but they were doing so on this day. However, he said they were enjoying blowing off steam, so they were going to vary from their setlist. Thus, they played "Disease." Trey mentioned that this song was named by Page, and that Page let him name "Cars Trucks Buses." Trey also mentioned how you probably have to live in New Jersey (and drive the Turnpike there) to understand the title of that song. ^^Trey introduced the song as a Los Lobos tune and dedicated it to them. #Trey referred to "Sleep" as a song they do not play very often. ##Played due to overwhelming crowd request. ###Trey introduced this song by mentioning it was played at Fish's request."

The band was short on equipment, so a hockey stick was used as a microphone stand.  Between sets, the DJ spun some Michael Jackson and Trey drummed along to the album.  The house music (which included more Michael Jackson) was presumably turned up after Fire to drown out the band.  The setlist may be incomplete, though, as the master tape contains nothing after Trey's sarcastic comments about Michael Jackson following Fire.  All songs are, of course, live debuts.  While this show is often billed as an ROTC Halloween Dance that took place on October 30, 1983, this is incorrect.
