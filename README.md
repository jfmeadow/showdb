# Analysis of Grateful Dead setlists

This is a side project mostly just to play with data visualizations and 
R analysis. 

The dataset comes from a database by the same name. It is rife with typos, 
as is to be expected, and so has to be updated from time to time when 
issues arise. 

This is a slow work in progress and is by no means final. 
But it sure is interesting thus far!
