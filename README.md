# Analysis of Grateful Dead setlists

This is a side project mostly just to play with data visualizations and 
R analysis. 

The dataset comes from a database by the same name. It is rife with typos, 
as is to be expected, and so has to be updated from time to time when 
issues arise. 

This is a slow work in progress and is by no means final. 
But it sure is interesting thus far! 

Also, the script reads out all song names for debugging and typo fixing, so there is a really long list in the output before the figures really get started.
